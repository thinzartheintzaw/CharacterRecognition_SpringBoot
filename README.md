# CharacterRecognition_SpringBoot

# Overview
This is a character recognition system developed using Java Spring Boot, integrated with a Telegram bot. It provides a user-friendly interface for recognizing characters from images, accessible both through a web interface and a Telegram bot. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to accurately identify characters and returns the recognized text to the user.

# Features
Web Interface: 
Users can upload images containing characters for recognition through a web interface.

Telegram Bot:
Integration with a Telegram bot allows users to upload images and receive character recognition results directly in their Telegram chats.
